Mason Mishael

![Here is my super duper image.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_1043.JPG)

My name is Mason Mishael. Currently I am a senior at Mercer University majoring in Technical Communication and minoring in Media Studies. My passions include, but are not limited to: multimedia, music production/music performance, carpentry/woodworking, and model trains. I am also a member of the Mercer Bearitones, Mercer's acapella group. I am in the middle of mixing our album that we recorded last semester.
