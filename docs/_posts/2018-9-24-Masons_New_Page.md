# This is my new content about how to make a new page!

Step 1. In the pages folder on your desktop, create a new file or copy an existing one to alter to your needs. Make sure this file ends with a ".md". This tells git that it is a markdown file.

Step 2. Once you have saved, committed, pushed, and checked your page to be to your satisfaction, you're ready to make a link.

Step 3. Copy your page's url and create a link to it on the homepage for easy access.
